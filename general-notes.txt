In Ship.ts, inheritance can be used to make code "dry".

beforeEach implementation needed for gameBoard tests.

after game starts, a helper method may delete all placable fields

helperfor gameBoard --> row, column to index --> you can ask at reactiflux for convention to name this

 getImplacableIndexes method may look better

coordinate should be number[] or <Coordinate> , there is ambugity

carefully inspect which properties can use getter method.

this.rival (red warning for typescript) search and if can't find solution, ask this to somewhere (reactiflux)

can you use constructor to initiate properties of according classes?

test for to place implacable coordinate

// how others do same game?
look for how game -> player -> gameboard -> ship objects relation
how rival player1 to player2?
how they planned and implemented tests?

To do
babel plug-in for styled components
definitely rename styled component and imported components names.
game.player1.gameBoard.coordinates <-- can you shorten this?
check if player see 1 battleships or single es/s at the end of the word.

More tests

if game is not started, there is no winner!
